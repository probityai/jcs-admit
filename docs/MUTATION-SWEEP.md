# Mutation sweep

Every refusal this crate makes, broken on purpose, to check that the tests
measure the mechanism rather than its presence. Run 2026-09-19. Each row: the
implementation edit, the suite it was run against, and what the crate ACCEPTED
with the refusal removed.

17 mutations, 17 caught. Two test gaps were found while PLANNING the sweep and
one more by running it; all three are closed in `tests/refusal_boundaries.rs`.

| R7 | red | NonIntegerNumber | `src/number.rs` | caught (red) | 2 of 15 rows diverge: / 1.5: want refused=true (non-integer), got Ok([49, 46, 53]) |
| M6 | mutate | NonIntegerNumber | `src/number.rs` | SURVIVED its target suite |  |
| R8 | red | NonFiniteNumber | `src/number.rs` | caught (red) | 1e400: want NonFiniteNumber, got Err(Canonicalization { detail: "NaN and +/-Infinity are not permitted in JSON" }) |
| M7 | mutate | NonFiniteNumber | `src/number.rs` | caught (red) | -1e400: want NonFiniteNumber, got Err(Canonicalization { detail: "NaN and +/-Infinity are not permitted in JSON" }) |
| R9 | red | TooLarge | `src/lib.rs` | caught (red) | want TooLarge, got Ok(6) |
| M8 | mutate | TooLarge | `src/lib.rs` | caught (red) | an input of exactly 20971520 bytes must be admitted, or the cap is off by one in the direction that refuses good evidence |

## The three gaps

**No negative non-finite token existed anywhere.** A finiteness check written
`v != f64::INFINITY` passed the entire suite; `-1e400` was untested. Closed by
`a_non_finite_number_is_refused_at_either_sign`, which now runs both signs and
also pins that the largest finite double is still admitted, so the guard cannot
pass by refusing everything large.

**Nothing asserted that an input of exactly `DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES` is admitted.**
A size check written `>=` passed the suite. An over-tight cap on a verifier
refuses documents that are perfectly good evidence, which is a failure in the
direction nobody tests for. Closed by `the_size_cap_admits_exactly_the_cap`.

**M6 survived the suite it was aimed at.** Reducing `is_integer` to
`exp10 >= 0` makes `0.0` a non-integer, and the whole `ijson_profile`
integration suite passed with that in place. Only a unit test on the private
decomposition helper caught it, and a unit test on a private helper does not
survive that helper being replaced. Closed by
`zero_is_an_integer_in_every_notation_at_the_entry_point`, which states the rule
at the public entry point; re-running M6 against it now fails there too.

## The one worth reading

R3 removes the unpaired-surrogate refusal and substitutes U+FFFD, which is what
an ordinary decoder does. `"\ud800"` and `"\udbff"` then canonicalize to the
same bytes, and so does a literal U+FFFD. Three distinct wire documents, one
canonical form, one signature that verifies for all three. That is the argument
for checking on the bytes, demonstrated rather than asserted.

R8 removes the finiteness refusal and the caller does not get an acceptance --
it gets `Error::Canonicalization { detail: "NaN and +/-Infinity are not
permitted in JSON" }`, the delegate's untyped message surfacing through the
seam, naming no token and no offset. That is the difference owning the refusal
makes.
