Admission control for JSON that is about to be signed or verified. It checks the raw bytes before
any parser sees them, refuses documents that two parsers could read differently, and then writes
the RFC 8785 canonical form.

It's for Rust code that signs, verifies or hashes canonical JSON, such as in-toto statements,
DSSE payloads or signed receipts.

## Quick start

Add it as a pinned dependency:

```bash
cargo add jcs-admit@0.1.0
```

Then admit a document before you sign it:

```rust
use jcs_admit::{admit, Error};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let canonical = admit(br#"{ "b": 1, "a": [1.0, 1e30] }"#)?;
    assert_eq!(canonical, br#"{"a":[1,1e+30],"b":1}"#);

    // One document, two readings: refused before any parser picks one.
    let refused = admit(br#"{"a":1,"a":2}"#);
    assert!(matches!(refused, Err(Error::DuplicateMember { .. })));

    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&canonical));
    Ok(())
}
```

`cargo run` prints `{"a":[1,1e+30],"b":1}`.

## What it refuses

It refuses a repeated object member, compared on the decoded name; nesting past a depth cap, 128
by default, the value the in-toto attestation specification sets; a string whose bytes aren't
Unicode scalar values, such as an unpaired surrogate or an overlong form; a number with no finite
double, and under the opt-in I-JSON profile an integer at or above 2^53; and an input past a size
cap. Each refusal is a named error variant carrying a byte offset, so a verifier can act on the
fault. Number formatting is delegated to
[serde_json_canonicalizer](https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_canonicalizer).

## Status

Version 0.1.0 on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/jcs-admit), minimum Rust 1.74. The tests
load vectors produced by the Go implementation in
[agent-evidence-vectors](https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-vectors), never by this crate,
and every refusal is mutation-tested.
