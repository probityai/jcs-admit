//! Admission control for JSON that is about to be signed or verified.
//!
//! One document has one canonical form, and a signature means nothing unless
//! every party agrees which bytes those are. RFC 8785 says how to write them.
//! This crate decides which documents are allowed to have them, refuses the rest
//! on the raw bytes, and then hands the writing to
//! [`serde_json_canonicalizer`].
//!
//! # Why a separate layer
//!
//! The two canonicalizers on crates.io are serde `Serializer`s. That is the
//! right shape for their job and it fixes where they can stand: a value has
//! already been parsed before either of them is reached, and the faults that
//! matter to a verifier are the ones that vanish during that parse. A repeated
//! object member is gone -- the map kept one of the two and nothing downstream
//! can tell it happened. There is no layer below them to put the check in, so the
//! check goes above them, on the bytes, which is this crate.
//!
//! Measured against `serde_json_canonicalizer` 0.3.2 on 2026-09-19 (the run is
//! pinned in `tests/incumbent_differential.rs`, which fails if any of it stops
//! being true):
//!
//! | input | the delegate | this crate |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `{"a":1,"a":2}` | `{"a":2}` via `pipe`, `{"a":1}` straight into its serializer | [`Error::DuplicateMember`] |
//! | 129 nested arrays | accepted by `to_vec`; 10,000 aborts the process | [`Error::TooDeep`] |
//! | `9007199254740993` | `9007199254740992`, a different integer | [`Error::UnsafeInteger`] |
//! | 12 MB of array | accepted | [`Error::TooLarge`] |
//!
//! The first row is the one to read twice. One document, one crate, two canonical
//! forms depending on which of its entry points you used, and both of them
//! signable.
//!
//! What the delegate gets right, it gets right for us: it formats numbers through
//! `ryu_js`, which is the ECMAScript `Number::toString` variant RFC 8785 section
//! 3.2.2.3 actually requires, and it reads the RFC's own awkward reference number
//! `333333333.33333329` correctly. This crate stands on that rather than carrying
//! a third copy of it.
//!
//! # What it refuses
//!
//! 1. **A repeated object member** ([`Error::DuplicateMember`]). Collapsing a
//!    repeat to last-wins is a split view: two parties read the same bytes as two
//!    different documents and a signature over either reading verifies.
//!    Comparison is on the DECODED name, so `"a"` and `"a"` are one member.
//! 2. **Nesting past a cap** ([`DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH`], 128 -- the value RFC 8785's
//!    in-toto profile made normative). Without a cap a crafted document
//!    overflows the stack, which no caller can catch and which happens before any
//!    signature is checked.
//! 3. **A string whose bytes are not Unicode scalar values**
//!    ([`Error::StringNotScalar`]): an unpaired surrogate escape, a surrogate
//!    written directly in UTF-8, an overlong form, a raw control character.
//!    Checked before any decode, because a decoder that substitutes U+FFFD
//!    leaves `"\ud800"`, `"\udc00"` and a literal U+FFFD canonicalizing to
//!    identical bytes.
//! 4. **A number with no finite double** ([`Error::NonFiniteNumber`]), and under
//!    the opt-in RFC 7493 profile ([`admit_ijson`]) an integer at or above 2^53
//!    ([`Error::UnsafeInteger`]) or a Unicode noncharacter.
//! 5. **An input past a size cap** ([`Error::TooLarge`]). A depth cap bounds the
//!    stack; a size cap bounds the heap.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use agent_evidence_admission::{admit, Error};
//!
//! assert_eq!(admit(br#"{ "b": 1, "a": [1.0, 1e30] }"#)?, br#"{"a":[1,1e+30],"b":1}"#);
//!
//! // The refusal the layer exists for, and it names the member.
//! assert!(matches!(
//!     admit(br#"{"a":1,"a":2}"#),
//!     Err(Error::DuplicateMember { .. })
//! ));
//! # Ok::<(), Error>(())
//! ```
