//! The single error type every entry point returns.
//!
//! Every variant names a fault a caller can branch on, and that is half the
//! reason this crate exists. The canonicalizer it delegates to reports what it
//! does refuse as an untyped `serde_json::Error` -- measured 2026-09-19, a lone
//! surrogate escape and nesting past its limit and a number out of range all
//! arrive as one opaque type carrying a line and a column -- so a verifier
//! reading it cannot treat a split-view document differently from a typo, and no
//! refusal names the cap it crossed or the member it repeated.
