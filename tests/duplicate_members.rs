//! PROPERTY 2: a repeated object member is REFUSED, never collapsed.
//!
//! Collapsing a repeat to last-wins is a split-view attack. Two parties read the
//! same bytes as two different documents, a signature over either reading
//! verifies, and nothing downstream can recover which reading the producer meant
//! -- the second member has already overwritten the first.
//!
//! The nested cases are copied from `aee/jcs_string_test.go`
//! (`TestJCSNestedDuplicateKey`) in the Go implementation this crate ports; see
//! `tests/vectors/PROVENANCE.md`. The escape-collision case and the
//! canonical-form case are this crate's own.
