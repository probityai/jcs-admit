//! The round-to-even digit tie, over a corpus rather than a handful of rows.
//!
//! ECMA-262 7.1.12.1 step 5 picks the shortest digit string that reads back as
//! the value, then the closest, and then -- the clause every shortest-float
//! formatter skips -- the EVEN one of two equidistant candidates. RFC 8785
//! section 3.2.2.3 defers to that algorithm by reference, so the clause is
//! normative here, and Appendix B carries exactly one row for it
//! (`43143ff3c1cb0959`). One row is enough to fail and not enough to characterise
//! a defect, which is what this corpus is for.
//!
//! Every token is a double whose exact decimal expansion terminates one digit
//! past its shortest form in a 5 -- the only shape where the choice exists. The
//! expected column is `String(Number(input))` from node v24.19.0, the algorithm
//! the specification defers to, read off an engine rather than reasoned about.
//! `tests/vectors/es-number-ties.tsv` carries the provenance.
//!
//! Two classes sit in one file on purpose. Where the even candidate is the LOWER
//! one, a formatter that rounds away from zero is wrong and the input differs
//! from the output. Where the even candidate is the UPPER one, that formatter is
//! already right and the input is its own canonical form. A correction that fires
//! on equidistance alone passes the first class and fails the second, which is
//! how the first version of this fix was caught.
//!
//! WHOSE BEHAVIOUR THIS NOW MEASURES. This crate does not format numbers. The
//! clause is implemented by `ryu_js` inside `serde_json_canonicalizer`, which
//! this crate delegates to, so these 850 rows are a test of the DEPENDENCY --
//! and the strongest single piece of evidence for delegating rather than
//! carrying a third copy of the algorithm. 850 rows read off node v24.19.0,
//! against a dependency written by someone else: if it passes, its correctness
//! is this crate's asset and the 437 lines of hand-rolled ECMAScript number
//! formatting that used to sit here were pure risk.
