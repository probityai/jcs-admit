//! ATTACK: the attacker must not choose the size of the refusal message.
//!
//! Three variants carry a fragment of the input verbatim -- the repeated member
//! name, and the offending number token -- and both are unbounded in the input,
//! so `Display` hands a caller's logger a string whose length the attacker set.
//! One 2 MiB document with a 1 MiB member name repeated produced a refusal
//! message of 1,048,618 characters, measured. A verifier that logs why it
//! refused a document is the normal case, so the amplification is on the path
//! that matters: refuse a document, write a megabyte; do it in a loop, and the
//! log is the outage.
//!
//! The name and the token stay intact in the STRUCT, because a caller matching
//! on the variant wants the real value. It is the human-readable rendering that
//! has to be bounded.
