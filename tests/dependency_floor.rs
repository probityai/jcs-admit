//! The version floors this crate declares for its runtime dependencies.
//!
//! A floor is a cost every dependent pays: `cargo` must resolve the dependent's
//! whole graph at or above it. 0.1.0 declared `serde = "1.0.229"` although it
//! builds with far less, and a host on serde 1.0.228 had its lockfile moved to
//! 1.0.229, which also brought in syn 3 beside syn 2.
//!
//! The `floors` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` resolves every dependency,
//! direct and transitive, to its declared minimum and runs the whole suite at
//! the MSRV, so it proves each floor below is enough. It cannot notice a floor that was
//! raised for no reason, because a higher floor also passes. This test does:
//! it fails when a runtime floor changes. Change the table only together with
//! the `floors` job showing the old floor no longer builds, and say why in
//! `CHANGELOG.md`.
