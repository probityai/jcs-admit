//! ATTACK: a gate that answers a different question than the verifier asks.
//!
//! `is_canonical` answered for RFC 8785 as written, with no way to ask under a
//! profile. Measured before the fix: a document carrying U+FFFF canonicalizes
//! under the default profile, `is_canonical` on those bytes returns `true`, and
//! `canonicalize_ijson` on the SAME bytes returns
//! `StringNotScalar: Unicode noncharacter in string`. A verifier that admits a
//! document with the gate and then verifies it under the profile has admitted
//! bytes its own profile refuses -- one document, two answers, from one crate.
