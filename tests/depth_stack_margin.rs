//! The depth ceiling has to be safe on the SMALLEST stack in ordinary use, not
//! just on the one the test harness happens to give the main thread.
//!
//! `tests/depth_cap.rs` already covers what the ceiling does: it clamps, it
//! refuses past itself, and it reaches the `serde_json` path. What no other test
//! establishes is the measurement the number rests on. The cap is a stack bound,
//! so a ceiling is only correct relative to a stack size, and asserting it on
//! an 8 MiB main thread proves it for a configuration much of the world does
//! not have -- a spawned thread gets 2 MiB by default, and a pool worker can be
//! given less.
//!
//! Measured on this crate in an unoptimized build: about 1.15 KiB of stack per
//! nesting level, so a 1 MiB thread survived 896 levels and died at 1024. The
//! ceiling of 512 is chosen against that, and this file is what keeps the
//! choice honest: if it ever ABORTS rather than fails, the per-level cost has
//! grown and `MAX_SUPPORTED_DEPTH` is what must come down.
//!
//! It lives on its own because its failure mode is process death, and
//! everything sharing a test binary with it would go down too.
