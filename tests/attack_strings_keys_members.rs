//! 317 adversarial documents aimed at strings, member names and members, each
//! pinned against an independent implementation.
//!
//! These are not examples. They are the cases where two conformant
//! canonicalizers most plausibly part company, enumerated rather than sampled:
//! every C0 control as an escape and again raw, DEL and the C1 range, each
//! escape whose mandated output differs from the escape that was written,
//! surrogate halves alone and mispaired and in either hex case, surrogates and
//! overlong forms and truncated sequences encoded directly in the bytes, the
//! Unicode noncharacters, member names differing only by escaping, only by
//! Unicode normalisation form, or only by hex case, the empty name, a name
//! carrying NUL, repeats at the top level and nested and inside an array
//! element, and member ordering across the boundary where UTF-16 code-unit
//! order stops agreeing with UTF-8 byte order.
//!
//! The expected column comes from the Go implementation named in
//! `tests/vectors/PROVENANCE.md`, not from this crate, so a shared mistake
//! cannot pass by agreeing with itself. A third implementation -- the RFC
//! author's own reference lineage, via `trailofbits/rfc8785.py` -- was run over
//! the same corpus at the value level and agreed byte for byte on all 178 cases
//! it can structurally express.
//!
//! Configuration: the Go rail applies the I-JSON string profile and the
//! integers-only tightening unconditionally, so the comparable configuration
//! here is `Options::ijson().integers_only(true)`. Under it, all 317 cases match
//! in accept-versus-refuse, and every accepted case matches byte for byte.
