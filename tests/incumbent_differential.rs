//! What this crate refuses that `serde_json_canonicalizer` accepts, run against
//! the real crate rather than described.
//!
//! This file exists to stop the crate's own reason for existing from becoming a
//! claim nobody re-checks. Every row was measured on 2026-09-19 against
//! `serde_json_canonicalizer` 0.3.2 (7,852,211 total and 5,259,528 recent
//! downloads, crates.io API, same day) resolving `serde_json` 1.0.151 and
//! `ryu-js` 1.0.3. If the delegate ever starts refusing one of these, this file
//! goes red and the crate's scope has to shrink. That is the point of committing
//! it.
//!
//! # The delegate has four public entry points and no two of them agree
//!
//! `to_vec`, `to_string` and `to_writer` take anything `Serialize`. `pipe` takes
//! a `&str` and routes it through `serde_json::from_str` into a
//! `serde_json::Value`. That difference decides everything below:
//!
//! - `pipe` inherits `serde_json`'s deserializer, so it does refuse a lone
//!   surrogate escape, a raw control character and nesting -- and it also
//!   inherits `serde_json::Value`, so a repeated member has collapsed to
//!   last-wins before the canonicalizer runs.
//! - the other three have no parser and therefore no depth bound at all.
//!
//! So there is no entry point that both refuses a duplicate member and bounds
//! nesting. Not a quality gap: the architecture has no layer to put either check
//! in, which is why this crate is a layer above rather than a rival beside.
//!
//! # The one thing measured here and NOT asserted
//!
//! `to_vec` on 10,000 nested arrays aborts the process:
//! `thread 'main' has overflowed its stack / fatal runtime error: stack
//! overflow`, exit status 134, core dumped. A stack overflow is an abort and not
//! a catchable failure, so asserting it would take this test binary down with it.
//! The assertion below stops at 1,000 -- accepted, uncapped -- and the abort is
//! recorded here with its exit code instead of being turned into a test that
//! cannot exist.
